# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all contributions! Whether it's fixing a bug, improving documentation, or creating a new feature, your help is appreciated. Below are the guidelines to make the contribution process smooth and consistent for everyone.

### How to Get Started

1. **Fork and Branch**
    - Start by forking the repository and cloning it to your local machine.
    - Create a new branch for your contribution. Use a descriptive name, like `<your-name>-<feature-description>` (e.g., `john-login-feature`), which clearly describes the purpose of the branch.

2. **Code Standards**
    - Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
    - Ensure your code is well documented, especially with functions, using [Doxygen-style](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) comments in headers. This helps others understand the functionality quickly.
    - Follow the project's existing code style, indentation, and naming conventions. Consistency is key.

3. **Commit Guidelines**
    - Make concise but descriptive commit messages. A good format is "`<area>: <description>`" (e.g., `UI: Fix window resize glitch`).
    - Keep your changes scoped to a single issue or feature. This makes it easier to review and, if necessary, revert without impacting other features.

4. **Documentation**
    - Update or add documentation where necessary. Good documentation can save other developers a lot of time.
    - Add usage examples, especially for new features, to help others get up to speed quickly.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (5. **Testing**)

[//]: # (    - If your changes affect the codebase significantly, add appropriate unit tests.)

[//]: # (    - Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.)

[//]: # (    - If adding a feature, consider including example code or test scripts that demonstrate the feature's intended use.)
[//]: # ( TODO Add this clause once we have something enough for a tests )

### Pull Request Process

1. **Sync with Upstream**
    - Before submitting a pull request, ensure your fork is up to date with the upstream repository. You can do this by adding a remote for the upstream and rebasing against it.

2. **Open a Pull Request**
    - Open a pull request (PR) on the upstream repository.
    - Ensure your PR has a clear description of the changes you've made, why they are important, and any related issue numbers.
    - Mark your PR as a draft if it is not ready for full review.

3. **Code Review**
    - Be prepared to respond to code review comments. The goal of the review process is to ensure quality and consistency.
    - Address feedback promptly, and remember that reviews are collaborative: reviewers want the best outcome for your contribution and the project.

4. **Stay Involved**
    - If your pull request introduces changes that could lead to future modifications or optimizations, mention this in your PR.
    - Respond to feedback or questions on your pull request. Communication is key!

### Other Ways to Contribute

- **Report Bugs**: If you find a bug, create an issue describing the bug, including steps to reproduce it if possible.
- **Feature Requests**: If you have ideas for improvements, open an issue to discuss them with the maintainers.
- **Improve Documentation**: Good documentation is essential for any project. If you notice gaps or errors, help by improving the docs.

### Code of Conduct

- Respect the community, and be polite in communications.
- Be open to constructive feedback, as it improves the quality of the project and helps everyone grow.
- Help others when you can, whether by reviewing code, answering questions, or contributing to discussions.
